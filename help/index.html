<h1>Novel Insight Scoring</h1>

<p>
Novel Insight Scoring is analytical CRM software for automatically scoring customers given example (scored) data. 
The user of the software can set optimization time and adjust risk level (pessimistic, neutral or optimistic scoring) and 
score new customers without detailed knowledge about data analysis and machine learning methods. 
The scoring results are stored in a CSV file for further processing and importing to databases etc.

<h1>Step by step example</h1>

<p>
To test how the program works, start program by clicking <b>start.exe</b> or <b>ni-scoring.jar</b>. If you don't have 
Java installed, install it from <a href="www.java.com/download/">here</a>.

<p>
After program has started. Select included CSV file <i>examples.csv</i> as pre-scored data 
by clicking the top most "Select CSV file..". 

<p>
Secondly, select data that will be scored by clicking the middle "Select CSV file.." button and select <i>customers.csv</i> data file
from the same directory where the program was installed. Then click the lowest of "Select CSV file" buttons to set the results
file ("results.csv") where scoring results will be saved.

<p>
Finally, set risk taking to zero (middle) and from Quality menu select optimization time to be "5 minutes". 
This will give you quick rough scoring results. After these steps click "Calculate scoring" button to 
start the optimization.

<p>
After optimization, you can view the resulting <i>results.csv</i> file where scoring values are in a same order as rows in 
<i>customers.csv</i> file.


<h1>Data files</h1>

<p>
To score customers, user must have two text (ASCII) files in CSV format. 
The files contain customer information given as floating point (or integer) numbers separated by spaces or commas. 
Customers are represented as vectors and each line of the file contains information from a single customer. 
The first file contains D+1 entries per line, 
where the first D numbers contain customer information and the last number of each row contain customer scoring. 
This can be total income from customer, activity level of customer etc. The second file contains D columns per line 
having same information as the first file but without scoring data.

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
Results text file has same number of lines as the second file (to be scored data) and contains scoring values 
for each row of the data file.

<h1>Options</h1>

<h2>Risk</h2>

<p>
User can adjust amount of risk taken by scoring. The machine learning algorithms estimate scoring value 
as well as its standard deviation (expected error). The actual score given to each customer can be either 1) pessimistic 
(negative risk values) meaning that lowest likely scoring value will be used, 2) neutral (zero risk value) meaning that 
expected/mean scoring value is used, and 3) optimistic (positive risk), meaning that highest likely scoring value is used.

<p>
Pessimistic risk means no uncertain customers get high scoring values and top customers are have very low probability of 
being invalid customers. This setting is maybe preferred initially, when aiming marketing campaign to can contact to 
the most high-valued customers.

<p>
Optimistic risk values means many uncertain cases are contacted. This means scoring now explores also 
new areas/customers that look promising. It is recommended that when repeating marketing campaigns etc. , one 
takes also some risk so that new fresh customerships have chance to develop.

<h2>Quality</h2>

<p>
The menu option can be used to set amount of time used in computing scoring model. 
Increasing optimization time leads to better analysis of uncertainties. If risk is set to zero, 
this value can be low as software computes then only expected scoring value and do not adjust scoring values.


<h1>Improving scoring results</h1>

<p>
Scoring results depend on quality of input data. The number of features (columns) per customer should be kept as low as 
possible by avoiding redundant data while keeping numbers as informative as possible. The software uses neural networks
as a prediction model.

<p>
The software optimizes scoring in parallel and gives better and better results if more computational time is available. 
This means that using faster multicore CPUs and/or increasing computing time through Quality menu leads
to better solutions. During calculations, "Analyzing uncertainty" reports number of iterations which describes total 
amount of computations performed and higher values typically leads to better results. Another value to look at in  
"Analyzing uncertainty" is percentage error term. The value should oscillate near 100% but the lowest value seen during
computations indicates the best solution found.
